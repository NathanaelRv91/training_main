Files that are saved for mi initial project setup

Welcome to my portal and display of my personal experiences, program projects for fitness training and journaling of events/experiences and opinions as they relate to my universe of hard excercise, hard work in data analytics and aspirations to do more and more in both of these spaces.

My Focus is to give followers and clients access to my more in-depth and personal content on GitHub that drives communication and participation of active clients on an organized platform. From here you will be able to reach me virtally 24/7 via my gmail account or my personal cell #. As I develop this page I will add repositories for Race Results, diet & training files and attach these links to my youube videos on my Youtube Channel: NathanaelVerduzco91. Being a Hybrid Athlete is no easy task; espicially being a good one. You have to be disciplined, diet focused and able to react to circumstances of training that keep you optimized on a 365-day per year basis. So take a look at my diet plan projects and model 1,2 & 3 Trainin Program files and let's get started!
