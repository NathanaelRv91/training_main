Files that are saved for mi initial project setup

Welcome to my portal and display of my personal experiences, program projects for fitness training and journaling of events/experiences and opinions as they relate to my universe of hard excercise, hard work in data analytics and aspirations to do more and more in both of these spaces. I started my professional career as a skinny kitchen manager in Hays, KS and now i enjoy a bi-annual trainng season of endurance racing and bodybuilding-style workouts.

I am an active Ironman 70.3 Athlete and Marathon Runner. I have completed a marathon in 3:04 and an Ironman in 6:31:00. 
As I move forward, I am certified in 5 specialties with the ISSA as a personal fitness trainer. My services i am building will provide diet advice (froma guy who put on 30 lb of muscle in 4 years), Endurance Training Advice and Ovrerall weigthlifting coaching with a "Hybrid" Approach. My Youtube channel NathanaelVerduzco91 better explains my lifelong approach in a short video format with added educational/comedic shorts. Check it out as you can see all my social media accounts are attached here on GitHub.

My Focus is to give followers and clients access to my more in-depth and personal content on GitHub that drives communication and participation of active clients on an organized platform. From here you will be able to reach me virtally 24/7 via my gmail account or my personal cell #. As I develop this page I will add repositories for Race Results, diet & training files and attach these links to my youube videos on my Youtube Channel: NathanaelVerduzco91. Take a look at m recent episode #5 of 'The Hybrid Athlete" Podcast: https://youtu.be/DC6wdJmLrxY

Being a Hybrid Athlete is no easy task; espicially being a good one. You have to be disciplined, diet focused and able to react to circumstances of training that keep you optimized on a 365-day per year basis. So take a look at my diet plan projects and model 1,2 & 3 Trainin Program files and let's get started!
